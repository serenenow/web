            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. NATURE AND APPLICABILITY OF TERMS</h2>
            <p>Please carefully read these Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") and the Privacy Policy available at <a href="/privacy-policy" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://www.serenenow.in/privacy-policy</a> ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") before accessing or using the SereneNow mobile applications or related services ("<strong>Services</strong>") offered by SereneNow. These Terms and the Privacy Policy together constitute a binding agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") between you and SereneNow concerning your use of the Services.</p>

            <p>The Agreement applies to you whether you are:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>A therapist, counselor, psychologist, or other licensed professional or organization listing services via SereneNow ("<strong>Practitioner</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>", or "<strong>User</strong>");</li>
              <li>A client, or their guardian or representative, using SereneNow to search for and book services with a Practitioner ("<strong>End-User</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>", or "<strong>User</strong>"); or</li>
              <li>Any other user accessing SereneNow's Services.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This Agreement governs access to and use of the following Services:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>For Practitioners: tools to list services, manage client interactions, set pricing and payment options, track appointments, and optionally subscribe to paid features;</li>
              <li>For End-Users: the ability to connect with a Practitioner, book sessions, manage appointment details, and receive relevant communication such as invoices and calendar invites.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>SereneNow currently supports both free and paid plans for Practitioners. Subscribed features may include unlimited services, calendar integrations, and enhanced client tools. Subscriptions may be subject to applicable taxes.</p>

            <p>Appointments facilitated through SereneNow may be paid for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Directly to the Practitioner</strong>: In this case, SereneNow only facilitates the initial connection and takes no responsibility for payments, refunds, or billing. It is the Practitioner's responsibility to confirm receipt of payment before approving the session.</li>
              <li><strong>Via SereneNow's platform</strong>: SereneNow collects payment from the End-User, including a nominal platform fee may apply to cover payment gateway and administrative costs, which is disclosed to End-Users during the booking process. In this case, SereneNow generates an invoice upon confirmation and facilitates payouts to the Practitioner after deducting applicable TDS.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each service listed by a Practitioner includes their individual cancellation and rescheduling policy. End-Users agree to these terms at the time of booking. Practitioners are currently unable to modify appointments directly, but that functionality is planned for future releases.</p>

            <p>Refunds are solely the responsibility of the Practitioner unless SereneNow is legally required to intervene. SereneNow does not currently mediate no-show disputes but may introduce policy guidance in future updates.</p>

            <p>By accessing or using any part of SereneNow's Services, you acknowledge and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with these Terms, you may not use the Services.</p>

            <p>SereneNow reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. If there are material changes, users will be notified via the app or email. Continued use of the Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

            <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of India and complies with the:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Indian Contract Act, 1872;</li>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>What information we collect from Users, including any sensitive personal data or information;</li>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.2 PRIVATE SERVICE INFORMATION AND CONTENT SHARED THROUGH THE PLATFORM</h3>

            <p><strong>3.2.1</strong> SereneNow does <strong>not</strong> publicly list or display profiles of Practitioners. All access to Practitioner information (such as name, qualifications, fees, and offered services) is shared <strong>only with invited clients</strong>, after a Practitioner has explicitly added a client to their account. Any such information is privately shared within the app interface and is only accessible to the relevant parties for the purpose of scheduling and conducting appointments.</p>

            <p><strong>3.2.2</strong> The Services provided by SereneNow and its technology providers are made available on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind (whether express or implied), including but not limited to implied warranties of accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. SereneNow does not make any guarantee or representation about the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of information shared by Users, including Practitioners. Any reliance on such information is at the User's sole risk.</p>

            <p><strong>3.2.3</strong> SereneNow is not liable for any damage to your device, software, or data resulting from use of the platform, including app downloads or updates. If you are dissatisfied with the platform, your sole remedy is to stop using the Services.</p>

            <p><strong>3.2.4</strong> If SereneNow determines that you have submitted false, misleading, or incomplete information—whether in your profile, client communications, or feedback—SereneNow may suspend or restrict your access. You may also be liable to indemnify SereneNow for any resulting losses or damage to its reputation, operations, or Users.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.3 BOOKING APPOINTMENTS</h3>

            <p>SereneNow enables Users to connect with Practitioners through private, code-based invitations. Appointments are booked using the SereneNow mobile app after a Practitioner shares their 6-digit code with the User.</p>

            <p><strong>3.3.1</strong> SereneNow provides a platform for Users to book confirmed appointments with their Practitioner. However, SereneNow is not liable if an appointment is later canceled or rescheduled by the Practitioner. Practitioners can define their own cancellation and rescheduling policies (including percentage-based charges), which will be shown at the time of booking and applied automatically. Refunds in such cases are at the sole discretion of the Practitioner.</p>

            <p><strong>3.3.2</strong> SereneNow does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or healthcare services. It is only a platform to manage appointments and enable communication. Therefore, SereneNow is not responsible for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Any interaction, treatment, or advice exchanged between a User and a Practitioner.</li>
              <li>The intent, quality, or ability of Practitioners to provide services.</li>
              <li>Any wrong diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, or perceived negligence.</li>
              <li>Cancellation, no-show, rescheduling, or changes in service fees (Users can view service-specific policies within the app before booking).</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3.3.3</strong> <strong>Client No-Show Policy</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>If a User fails to attend a booked appointment without canceling in advance, the Practitioner may mark the session as a no-show and charge a cancellation fee as per their defined policy.</li>
              <li>SereneNow does not suspend or block users for repeated no-shows, but cancellation charges (if set by the Practitioner) will still apply.</li>
              <li>Practitioners may waive cancellation charges at their discretion by manually canceling the appointment on the client's behalf before the scheduled time.</li>
              <li>SereneNow does not evaluate or arbitrate the reasons for no-shows and does not issue platform-level refunds for them.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3.3.4</strong> <strong>Cancellation and Refund Policy</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>If a Practitioner cancels or fails to meet the User, and the User has paid through SereneNow, the User may contact support@serenenow.com within five (5) days. If applicable, the full consultation amount will be refunded to the User within 5–6 business days.</li>
              <li>If the User cancels or reschedules, the refund amount will depend on the cancellation policy set by the Practitioner at the time of booking.</li>
              <li>If the User does not attend the session without canceling, no refund will be issued unless the Practitioner decides to waive the cancellation fee.</li>
              <li>Delays in appointment start time do not qualify for refunds if the Practitioner eventually completes the session.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.4 NO PRACTITIONER–END-USER RELATIONSHIP; NOT FOR EMERGENCY USE</h3>

            <p><strong>3.4.1</strong> Some information available within the SereneNow app—including but not limited to text, data, graphics, images, or suggestions—may be provided by Practitioners. However, SereneNow merely acts as a platform to facilitate connections and manage appointments. The use of the platform does not create a doctor–patient or therapist–client relationship between SereneNow and any User.</p>

            <p><strong>3.4.2</strong> All content or communication made available through the SereneNow app, whether by Practitioners or otherwise, is for general informational purposes only. SereneNow makes no guarantees or warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy, quality, or qualifications of any Practitioner using the platform. Users are solely responsible for their decisions and interactions with Practitioners, and SereneNow shall not be liable for any actions taken based on the information presented within the app.</p>

            <p><strong>3.4.3</strong> SereneNow is not intended for use in emergency situations. If you or someone else is facing a medical or mental health emergency, you must contact your local emergency services or go to the nearest hospital or appropriate care provider. The platform does not support urgent care, suicide prevention, or emergency consultations.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.5 CONSULTATIONS</h3>

            <p><strong>3.5.1</strong> Online consultations facilitated through SereneNow are conducted via third-party platforms such as Google Meet. SereneNow only assists in sending calendar invites and meeting links after an appointment is confirmed.</p>

            <p><strong>3.5.2</strong> SereneNow does not record or monitor any part of the consultation. The conduct, content, and outcomes of online consultations are entirely the responsibility of the Practitioner and the User.</p>

            <p><strong>3.5.3</strong> Users are advised to ensure a secure and private environment during their consultations. SereneNow is not responsible for technical issues, interruptions, or misuse of third-party tools such as Google Meet.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. TERMS OF USE – PRACTITIONERS</h2>
